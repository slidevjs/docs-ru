## Help on Translating

<!-- For translations maintainers: You don't need to translate this port -->

First of all, thank you for being interested in contributing to translations!

You can find the repositories for each existing translation above. To help improve them, simply sending a Pull Request to their repo.

If the language you want to contribute isn't on the list, 

- Join [our Discord server](https://chat.sli.dev), and find the `#translations` channel to see if someone is already working on the language you want, consider joining them and translate together. If not, you can start a new translation project with the following steps.
- Fork the main docs repo: [slidevjs/docs](https://github.com/slidevjs/docs)
- Start doing the translation by replacing the English text in-place.
- Share your repo's link to the `#translations` channel telling people you are working on it and find collaborators.
- When you finish the translation (at least 90%), `@antfu` in the Discord and we will invite you to the org and make the translation official.
- Once the transferring is done, we will set up the subdomain, auto-deployment, and a daily sync-up bot to keep the translation up-to-date with the latest English docs.
- The site is live, and we will send a shout-out tweet on [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Slidevjs).
